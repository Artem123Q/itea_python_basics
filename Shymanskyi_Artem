'''Create a game - 21.
There are 10 cards representing values 2-11.
The goal is to get max points, but less then 21. Each turn a player should decide pick a new card o pass.
Pick - value of a card should be added to player's points. If player gets more then 21 points - he lost.
Pass - no new cards, player stays with current points.
Results should be shown only after all the players passed.

Level 1 - one player.
Level 2 - one player + one bot.
Level 3 - one player + two bots.

To generate a random card use:
from random import randint
randint(2, 11)
